# playlistExtractor
Python script used to generate Volumio 2 playlists from iTunes library.

The purpose is that if you have your iTunes library backed up to a network drive, or just stored on a network drive, you can point this script at it and update your playlists in volumio from it.
This requires pyitunes (https://github.com/liamks/pyitunes). It can run on a crontab job to update things regularly.
